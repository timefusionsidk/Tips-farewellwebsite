# Farewell-website

# DISCO TILL DAWN — ✦ CELESTIAL ELEGANCE ✦

A scroll-controlled farewell invitation for the graduating class of 2026. Next.js, strict TypeScript, React, Three.js / React Three Fiber, and original Blender assets. No backend, sign-in, RSVP, or countdown.

## Run

Node.js 22+ recommended. `npm install`, `npm run dev`. For release: `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, then `npm start`. The production site is the static `out/` directory and can run on any static HTTPS host. Preview and production caches are separate. Assets use root-relative URLs.

## Editing

- `lib/scene/sceneConfig.ts`: ten scene IDs, normalized boundaries, camera positions, mobile framing, atmosphere and asset associations.
- `lib/scene/sceneTimeline.ts`: deterministic progress, easing and native-scroll length. No scroll hijacking or event queues.
- `lib/scene/invitationCopy.ts`: authoritative text, punctuation and emojis.
- `components/ui/SceneCopy.tsx`: readable HTML typography beats.
- `components/experience/`: independently maintained environments, camera, mirrored hero assets, star field, book, dawn, and ticket.
- `lib/audio/audioConfig.ts`: the centralized soundtrack map. Production playback is Song0, Song1, Song2, Song5, Song6, then Song9; Song3, Song4, Song7, and Song8 are intentionally disabled. See `public/audio/README.md`.
- `lib/scene/videoConfig.ts`: optional future clips and a 40-second total duration validator. This build uses **0 seconds of pre-rendered video**. All camera travel remains interactive.

## Original assets

`scripts/create_assets.py` generates the sculpted flower and individual mirror-tile sphere. Run with Blender 5.2: `blender -b --python scripts/create_assets.py`. GLB files are consumed by the site. Blender sources are retained in `assets/blender/`; no third-party art or reference-site assets are used. Procedural substitutes survive model-loading failures.

## Presentation and accessibility

In development only, open `/?present=1` for restart, scene selection, animation pause/resume, and statistics. Production strips the controls. All meaningful text is HTML. The ticket is a native keyboard-operable button. Reduced motion disables ticket zoom and ambient rotation and stabilizes the camera. WebGL failure renders the full static invitation. Initial scroll restoration is disabled; reload starts at the ticket. Mobile uses different camera distances, particle budgets, lighting and object density.

The automatic Troll opening is non-scroll-driven and hands off to the ticket through a particle morph. Audio attempts to start with the opening and also unlocks on the first gesture for browser autoplay policies. Do not add track filenames to any visual component.
